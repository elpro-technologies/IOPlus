# IOPlus
This is a simulator for the logic interpreter used in ELPRO RTUs. The core library is the same as used in the actual devices. 

The code consists of the demo application using gtk library for windows, and the interpreter library.
The interpreter library is identical to the library used in the ELPRO 915/925/415 etc product series.
