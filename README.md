# IOPlus
This is a simulator for the logic interpreter used in ELPRO RTUs. The core library is the same as used in the actual devices. 

The code consists of the demo application using gtk library for windows, and the interpreter library.
The interpreter library is identical to the library used in the ELPRO 915/925/415 etc product series.

Building:
 This code was last built in (around) 2016 using a since lost toolchain.
 from my (unreliable) memory - you need to install msys with mingw32 toolchain, and gtk-runtime 3.8.1 for i686.
 Once the toolchain and gtk are installed, you should be able to build from the command line.
